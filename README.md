<b>"This project involves implementing object detection using YOLOv5." </b>
if you want to learn yolov5 algorithm you can visit - https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5

so basically to implement this project you need to download the dataset folder which contains two thing 
  1. Images
  2. Annotations

. images have 3 files test train val 
. and labels have 2 files train and val 
. label files contain Txt files and image files contain JPG files 
. this is the required format for yolov5

. and the dataset files are also arranged in the format of yolov5 


...................................yolov5..........................................
Now let's go to the implementation of the project to implement you just need to download the dataset 
and after downloading you need to put some commands in your vs-code terminal to use yolov5.

  1. git clone https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5  # clone
  2. cd yolov5
  3. pip install -r requirements.txt  # install

so this will import yolov5 and also  install the requirements needed for yolov5
